    <p>A boy who ran out from his city to Tokyo , because he felt exhausted living in his own place. 
       When he is starving due to drinking a cup of soup as his dinner for three days , he met Hina , 
       giving him a free hamburger. To show his appreciation he decided to help Hina when she was in 
       trouble. They use Hina's special power to earn money for living. When Hina told him that she is 
       going to disappear , Hodaka feels regret and try his best to bring Hina Back.
